  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/loader/loader.json
    - assets/loader/404.json
    - assets/loader/sound_wave.json
    - assets/loader/rolling_loader.riv

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #   - family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
